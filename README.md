# RandomPasswordGenerator

Create an application that an employee can use to generate a random password based on criteria theyâ€™ve selected by modifying starter code. This app will run in the browser, and will feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by JAVASCRIPT code that you write. It will have a clean and polished user interface.

This program generates password of length between 4 to 20 characters based on user preferences in terms of password length, choice of combinations of upper case letters, lower case letters, numbers and/or special characters.

It also predict the strength of password by showing strength color
White -> when No check box is selected
Green -> show strong password, when all checkbox is selected
Red -> show average strength of password
yellow -> show weak password strength

There is a copy button use to copy the random password and paste to anywhere.
